    <div class="project">
      <h3>ESP8266 Based Intelligent Home Automation System</h3>
      <p>I spearheaded the development of an advanced home automation system leveraging the power of ESP8266, an embedded Wi-Fi microcontroller, to create an intelligent and interconnected environment. This project revolutionized the way we interact with our homes, offering seamless control over electrical appliances, lighting, and fans through voice commands, web interfaces, and physical switches.

        By integrating ESP8266 with various technologies and platforms, our intelligent home automation system provided a user-friendly and versatile solution.
        
        Here are some key features and functionalities:
        Voice-Controlled Automation: The system seamlessly integrated with popular voice assistants such as Google Assistant, allowing users to control home appliances using simple voice commands. Whether it was turning on lights, adjusting fan speed, or activating specific scenarios, voice control provided a hands-free and effortless experience.
        
        Web-Based Interface: Our system included a user-friendly web interface accessible offline (In case of internet failure) from any device with a browser. Through this interface, users could remotely monitor and control their home appliances, customize schedules, and create automation routines. The intuitive design and real-time feedback enhanced convenience and flexibility.
        
        Redundancy and Reliability: To ensure uninterrupted operation, we implemented a fail-safe mechanism using physical switches integrated into the switchboard. In the event of network or device failures, users could rely on traditional switch controls to operate appliances manually, guaranteeing continuous functionality.</p>

      <h3>Human Action Detection</h3>
      <p>I recently worked on a fascinating project focused on human activity recognition using a pretrained model called resnet-34_kinetics.onnx. This project aimed to automatically detect and classify human activities in videos, enabling a wide range of applications in fields such as surveillance, healthcare, and sports analysis.

        Using OpenCV and deep learning techniques, I developed an intelligent system that analyzed video streams or files to identify various human activities in real-time. The resnet-34_kinetics.onnx model provided a powerful backbone for the recognition task, leveraging its extensive training on a large-scale human activity dataset.
        
        The project resulted in an efficient and accurate human activity recognition system, capable of identifying a wide range of actions including walking, running, sitting, and more. The system's applications extended beyond security and surveillance, encompassing areas such as healthcare monitoring, sports performance analysis, and behavior understanding</p>
